**Registration**

On the launch of the app, you can create a new account by pressing the [font=fonts/NotoSans_RI.ttf]Register[/font] button. For that, you'll need to fill out a form containing the following fields:

[color=#295B90][font=fonts/NotoSans_RI.ttf]When you'll finish, you will be automatically logged in with your new account.[/font][/color]

**Authentification**
--------------------
To log in to your account, you'll have to enter a login and password.

[color=#295B90][font=fonts/NotoSans_RI.ttf]Keep in mind: for safety purposes you can't log in to multiple accounts from the same IP-address.[/font][/color]

Application settings such as the language, UI theme, etc.

[color=#295B90][font=fonts/NotoSans_RI.ttf]We guarantee that there won't be any advertising or spam emails sent by our application.[/font][/color]

**Application settings**
------------------------
In this section, you can select a language and a theme, as well as create custom smiles.

[color=#295B90][font=fonts/NotoSans_RI.ttf]You need to restart the app when you change language or theme of the application.[/font][/color]

**User search**
---------------
To add new friends, you need to press the [font=fonts/NotoSans_RI.ttf]Add[/font] button in the menu and enter a username in a popup. Then you can send that user an add request.

You can only send messages to a user after he accepts your request. You can send one optional message with the request.

**User list**
-------------
On the right of the menu there are these user sections:

* [color=#000050]Favorites[/color] - these are the friends that you want to quickly access or just keep them somewhere special :3
* [color=#000050]Incoming requests[/color] - users that want to add you to friends
* [color=#000050]Online / Offline[/color] - users from your friends list that are online or offline
* [color=#000050]Outcoming requests[/color] - list of users who have pending requests from you
* [color=#000050]Blacklisted[/color] - here are the users from who you don't want to receive messages

These lists will be automatically updated.

**Sending a message**
---------------------
Select a user from a list to send him a message. All incoming messages will be displayed immediately, without any need to manually update the list.

Also you can add smiles to messages, default or custom. Just press the smile button next to the message field.

If you press on a message, you'll see a popup with additional info, such as precise time and date and unwrapped message text.
Inside the dialog, there are a few options:

* [color=#000050]Load more messages[/color]

View the older message history of the dialog.

* [color=#000050]Search for messages[/color]

Search for messages containing certain text and sent in a certain period of time.

* [color=#000050]Delete dialog[/color]

Self-explanatory :p

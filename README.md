# Chat-Client
Simple desktop chat client written in Python.

=============

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Here is a list of Python dependencies we're using right now:

* [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy)
* [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado)

A good news is that you don't need to install them when using prebuilt package.

=============

### Installation
Here is a step by step example of how you can get our app up and running:

#### From Precompiled Package (recommended)
1. Head over to the latest release and grab the most suitable package for you. 
2. The last thing you need is to open the file you've just downloaded. 
3. Done'n'done :saxophone::turtle:

#### Using The Source Code
You can download the latest code from `master` using the special button on this page. _**Caution**_: there might be some errors even on master branch so we do not want you to use this code without any special occasion. Releases are just fine for you because of that :smiley_cat:

#### Packet Manager
Coming later :zap:

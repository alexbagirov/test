# Chat-Client
Simple desktop chat client written in Python.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Here is a list of Python dependencies we're using right now:

* [Kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy)
* [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado)
* [rsa](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rsa)

The good news is that you don't need to install them when using prebuilt package.

### Installation
Here is a step by step example of how you can get our app up and running:

#### From Precompiled Package (recommended)
1. Head over to the latest release and grab the most suitable package for you. 
2. Run the file you've just downloaded. 
3. Done'n'done :saxophone::turtle:

#### Using The Source Code
You can download the latest code from `master` using the special button on this page.  
_**Caution**_: development version is unstable and may contain errors of any kind. To improve security and user experience, we **highly** recommend you not to use the source code directly, but instead grab a packages from _Releases_ :smiley_cat:
